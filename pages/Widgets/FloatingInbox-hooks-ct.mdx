# Floating Inbox (Hooks) CT

The widget is a floating messaging component designed to allow for integrating web3 messaging in any website. Uses React SDK hooks.

<div className="widget-container">
  <FloatingInbox env="production" />
</div>

### Props

Integrating the Inbox component into your application is simple. Here's an example of how to include it in your component tree:

- `wallet`: (Optional) Sends the current signer of the wallet.
- `env`: XMTP developer environment. Read more [here](https://xmtp.org/docs/build/authentication#environments)

### Usage

```jsx
<FloatingInbox wallet={signer} env="production" />
```

#### Programmatic Control

The Inbox widget can be controlled programmatically using global methods to open or close it. These methods provide flexibility in interacting with the Inbox across different components.

Use the following command to open or close the Inbox:

```jsx
window.Inbox.open();
window.Inbox.close();
```

#### Example Integration

Here's an example of how you can create buttons to open and close the Inbox within a section of your application:

```jsx
<section >
  <button onClick={() => window.Inbox.open()}>Open Inbox</button>
  <button onClick={() => window.Inbox.close()}>Close Inbox</button>
</section>

<FloatingInbox />
```

### Installation

Install required dependencies

```bash
npm install @xmtp/xmtp-js ethers
```

Copy paste the component into your project

```jsx
//code
```

Import the component into your project

```jsx
import { Inbox } from "./Inbox";
```

#### Wallet Signer

Please note that all widgets in this library that require a wallet signer only accept an instance of the `ethers.js` signer. Other types of signers are not supported at this time.

The signer is optional. If the signer is not detected, the widgets have a built-in mechanism to establish a connection.

For example, when using the `Subscribe` or `Inbox` widgets, you should provide an `ethers.js` signer instance like so:

```jsx
<Subscribe
  // Other props
  wallet={signer}
/>
```

```jsx
<FloatingInbox
  // Other props
  wallet={signer}
/>
```

Ensure that you have properly initialized the `ethers.js` signer instance before passing it to the widget.
