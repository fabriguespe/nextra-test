# Enabling Subscribers with XMTP

import { Subscribe } from "/components/Subscribe";
export const subscribeArray = [];

This tutorial will guide you on how to create a simple `Subscribe` that enables the user to subscribe to your messages or notifications.

<div className="widget-container">
  <Subscribe
    theme="default"
    size="medium"
    onConsentChange={(address, state) => {
      console.log("New subscriber: ", address, state);
      let subscriber = subscribeArray.find(sub => sub.address === address);
      if (subscriber) subscriber.state = state;
      else subscribeArray.push({ address, state });

      document.getElementById("subscribeArray").innerText =
        "subscribeArray:"+JSON.stringify(subscribeArray);
    }}
    onError={(error) => console.log("Error subscribing: " + error)}
    env="production"

/>

</div>
<div id="subscribeArray" style={{ textAlign: "center", fontSize: "12px" }}></div>

### Import XMTP and Ethers Library

Import the necessary XMTP and Ethereum packages. These libraries enable you to create an XMTP client and interact with the Ethereum blockchain.

```jsx
import React, { useEffect, useState } from "react";
import { Client } from "@xmtp/react-sdk";
import { ethers } from "ethers";
```

The receiver of the subscription is gong to be a random wallet generated by ethers, but you could send your own wallet as prop.

```jsx
// Check if signer exists, if not create a new one
let signerTemp = signer ? signer : null;
if (!signerTemp) {
  // Create a random wallet if wallet does not exist
  let randomWallet = wallet || ethers.Wallet.createRandom();
  // Create a new client with the random wallet
  signerTemp = await Client.create(randomWallet, { env: env });
  // Set the signer
  setSigner(signerTemp);
}
```

### Subscribe with Ethereum Wallet

Your `connectWallet` function facilitates the connection to the user's Ethereum wallet.

```jsx
const connectWallet = async () => {
  if (typeof window.ethereum !== "undefined") {
    try {
      await window.ethereum.request({ method: "eth_requestAccounts" });
      const provider = new ethers.providers.Web3Provider(window.ethereum);
      return provider.getSigner();
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("User rejected request", error);
    }
  } else {
    console.error("Metamask not found");
  }
};
```

### Consent State Management

This section delves into a crucial part of the subscription widget â€” managing the consent state of a subscriber. We'll explore how to get the subscriber's address, refresh the consent list, get the current consent state, and then update it based on user actions.

### Get the Subscriber Address

The first step in managing the consent is to identify who the subscriber is. We accomplish this by getting the address of the connected wallet.

```jsx
const subscriberAddress = await getAddress(await connectWallet());
```

In this snippet, the `getAddress` and `connectWallet` functions fetch the Ethereum address of the subscriber.

### Refresh the Consent List

To ensure we're working with the most up-to-date information, we refresh the consent list.

```jsx
signerTemp.contacts.refreshConsentList();
```

The `refreshConsentList()` method updates the internal list of consent states managed by the `signer` object.

### Retrieve the Current Consent State

After refreshing, we get the current consent state of the subscriber.

```jsx
let state = signerTemp.contacts.consentState(subscriberAddress);
```

Here, `consentState()` fetches the consent state (`allowed`, `blocked`, or `unknown`) for the given `subscriberAddress`.

### Update the Consent State

Based on the current state, we either allow or block the subscriber.

```jsx
if (state == "unknown" || state == "blocked") {
  await signerTemp.contacts.allow([subscriberAddress]);
} else if (state == "allowed") {
  await signerTemp.contacts.block([subscriberAddress]);
}
```

- If the state is `unknown` or `blocked`, we change it to `allowed` using `signerTemp.contacts.allow()`.
- If the state is `allowed`, we change it to `blocked` using `signerTemp.contacts.block()`.

### Refresh the Consent List Again and Get the New State

After updating, we refresh the consent list again and check the new state to confirm that the change was successful.

```jsx
await signerTemp.contacts.refreshConsentList();
state = signerTemp.contacts.consentState(subscriberAddress);
```

We refresh the list and get the new consent state using the same methods as before.
