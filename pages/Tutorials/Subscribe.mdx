# Enabling Subscribers with XMTP

import { Subscribe } from "/components/Subscribe";

This tutorial will guide you on how to create a simple `Subscribe` that enables the user to subscribe to your messages or notifications.

<div className="widget-container">
  <Subscribe
    theme="default"
    size="medium"
    onSubscribe={(address) => console.log("New subscriber: " + address)}
    onUnsubscribe={(address) => console.log("Unsubscribed: " + address)}
    onError={(address) => console.log("Error subscribing: " + address)}
    env="production"
  />
</div>

### Step 1: Import XMTP and Ethers Library

Import the necessary XMTP and Ethereum packages. These libraries enable you to create an XMTP client and interact with the Ethereum blockchain.

```jsx
import React, { useEffect, useState } from "react";
import { Client } from "@xmtp/react-sdk";
import { ethers } from "ethers";
```

### Step 3: Subscirbe with Ethereum Wallet

Your `connectWallet` function facilitates the connection to the user's Ethereum wallet.

```jsx
const connectWallet = async () => {
  if (typeof window.ethereum !== "undefined") {
    try {
      await window.ethereum.request({ method: "eth_requestAccounts" });
      const provider = new ethers.providers.Web3Provider(window.ethereum);
      return provider.getSigner();
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("User rejected request", error);
    }
  } else {
    console.error("Metamask not found");
  }
};
```

### Step 4: Initialize Your subscribers

The very first step is to create an array that will store all the Ethereum addresses of the subscribed users.

```jsx
let subscriptionArray = [];
```

### Step 5: Define `Subscribe` and `Unsubscribe` Functions

#### Subscribe Function

When a user decides to subscribe, a new XMTP client is created specifically for that user. The Ethereum address is then appended to the `subscriptionArray` only after successful client creation. Here's a deeper look into how it works:

```jsx
async function subscribe(signer) {
  // Create a new XMTP client
  const xmtp = await Client.create(signer, { env: env });

  // Fetch the Ethereum address from the signer
  const address = await signer.getAddress();

  // Append the Ethereum address to the subscriptionArray
  if (!subscriptionArray.includes(address)) {
    subscriptionArray.push(address);
    // Trigger any additional XMTP logic for handling the subscription
    if (onSubscribe) onSubscribe(xmtp.address);
  }
}
```

_Creating a new XMTP client is crucial because it enables the address on the XMTP network_

#### Unsubscribe Function

Unsubscribing is a relatively straightforward process, but it's crucial to ensure that the XMTP client tied to the user is properly shut down or invalidated.

```jsx
async function unsubscribe(signer) {
  // Fetch the Ethereum address from the signer
  const address = await signer.getAddress();

  // Remove the Ethereum address from the subscriptionArray
  const index = subscriptionArray.indexOf(address);
  if (index > -1) {
    subscriptionArray.splice(index, 1);
    // Trigger any additional XMTP logic for handling the unsubscription
    if (onUnsubscribe) onUnsubscribe(address);
  }
}
```

_Unsubscribing is only done at client level , not at protocol level._

### Step 6: Implement the `checkSubscriptionStatus` Function

This function checks the subscription status of a given Ethereum address by looking up its presence in `subscriptionArray`. This simultes of you have a local DB in your project and you want to check there first.

```jsx
async function checkSubscriptionStatus(address) {
  return subscriptionArray.includes(address);
}
```

Then, you can call this function in the React component's `useEffect` to set the initial status.

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  const init = async () => {
    if (checkSubscriptionStatus && wallet) {
      const address = await getAddress(wallet);
      const isSubscribed = await checkSubscriptionStatus(address);
      setSubscriptionStatus(isSubscribed ? "subscribed" : "unsubscribed");
    }
  };
  init();
}, [checkSubscriptionStatus, wallet]);
```
